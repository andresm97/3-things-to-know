Right now, the tech industry is a hot place where the youngest want to make a career. But, like anything else, there's a lot of information about good practices, where to start, how to become better, etc. So whit a lot of information, some people could paralyze trying to find a way to become better.
With that in mind, we look through Stack Overflow's developer survey, trying to find some interesting ideas about how to improve your career (or even start it), what to do when you feel stuck and where are the better places to start learning.
Whit no more to say, here are three things that will help you in your career:

### 1. What tools are the most used it?

There are a lot of tools, some general and others focusing on just one thing. But if you want to start a career in tech, you must learn how to use **GIT and DOCKER.**

We are accustomed to only learning new programming languages, leaving behind some tools that will boost your career exponentially if you are new. In the next graph, we can see the percentage of people in the tech world who use the tools, where we can clearly see that more than 65% goes to Git and Docker.

### 2. What do you do when you get stuck on a problem?

Something that always will happen to you working in tech (pretty at almost field) is that usually you will get stuck trying to find a solution. How you face these problems, how you manage the situation and your emotions will define how good you are. 

There are a lot of ways to manage this situation, but keep in mind this **DON´T TRY ALWAYS THE SAME THING**.
On the next graph are the percentage of the answers to these questions. We can see that the top are google it and visit Stack Over Flow (you do not need more to become an engineer LOL)

In  my personal opinion, those are the best. But when you will that there's no light at the end of the tunnel… just relax, try something else and you will see you will solve it.


### 3. How did you learn to code?

If you are new in the space or want to change to another field, one question that you will have is how and where to start learning. Instead of wasting time trying to find the best resource, look at what the data tell us:

There is not much difference between the options (Online resources, School, Books, etc). This is because all of us learn in different ways, so we should focus on the type of learning that fits best for us.

One interesting thing is if we look at how many different types of learning a person does, we see that a lot of o people learn at 2 or more places.

### Conclusion 

Here we can see that we have a lot of options about any step of the process of improving your career, so here a let you 3 of my best pieces of advice:

- Do not feel overwhelmed, just start doing things and you see how you will become better at doing it. 
- At any feel, consider learning git and docker. 
- NEVER STOP LEARNING
